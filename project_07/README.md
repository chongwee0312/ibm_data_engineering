# Project Title
Creating a Scheduled Backup Script for a Tech Company

# Scenario
Imagine that you are a lead Linux developer at the top-tech company ABC International Inc. ABC currently suffers from a huge bottleneck: each day, interns must painstakingly access encrypted password files on core servers and back up any files that were updated within the last 24 hours. This process introduces human error, lowers security, and takes an unreasonable amount of work.

As one of ABC Inc.'s most trusted Linux developers, you have been tasked with creating a script called `backup.sh` which runs every day and automatically backs up any encrypted password files that have been updated in the past 24 hours.

# Tools / Software
