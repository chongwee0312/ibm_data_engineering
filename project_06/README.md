# Project Title
Historical Weather Forecast Comparison to Actuals

# Scenario
You've been tasked by your team to create an automated Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to extract daily weather forecast and observed weather data and load it into a live report to be used for further analysis by the analytics team. As part of a larger prediction modelling project, the team wants to use the report to monitor and measure the historical accuracy of temperature forecasts by source and station.

For each day at noon (local time), you will gather both the actual temperature and the temperature forecasted for noon on the following day for Casablanca, Morocco.

At a later stage, the team anticipates extending the report to include lists of locations, different forecasting sources, different update frequencies, and other weather metrics such as wind speed and direction, precipitation, and visibility.

# Tasks
In this project, the folliowing tasks will be performed.
- Initialise a log file.
- Write a bash script to download, extract and load raw data into a report.
- Add some basic analytics to the report
- Schedule the report to update daily
- Measure and report on historical forecasting accuracy.curacy

# Tools / Software
