# Project Title
Setup Test and Optimizing a Data Platform

# Scenario
For this project you will assume the role of database administrator at a data analytics consulting company. You have been assigned to a project where you need to setup, test and optimize the data platform. The platform contains different on premises database servers like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and cloud-based databases like IBM DB2. Your job is to configure, tune, secure, backup and monitor those databases and keep them running at peak performance

You have assumed the role of database administrator for the PostgreSQL server and you will perform the User Management tasks and handle the backup of the databases.

You have assumed the role of database administrator for the MySQL server and will perform the tasks like configuration check, recovery of data. You will use indexing to improve the database performance. You will identify which storage engines are supported by the server and which table uses which storage engine. Optionally You will also automate backup tasks.

You have been assigned the work to provison a cloud instance of IBM DB2 server and perform the tasks like restoration of data, index creation to improve the query performance. You will create views to make queries easier to write. Optionally You will also connect to the cloud instance of IBM DB2 server and from command line.
